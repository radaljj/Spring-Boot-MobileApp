# Spring-Boot-MobileApp
Spring boot application that uses Spring security, JDBC, multiple controllers, thymeleaf(front end).This application allows users to register in order to have full acces to admin part of the application which allows him to have CRUD controls on Database objects. Users that access the application without admin login they can only see the objects from the database as well as use a search option to sort the objects from the database(they cannot use CRUD).
